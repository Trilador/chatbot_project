Query: Do you know how to program?
Response: Seriously, do you?  You heard they're giving this away and will make you rich.  How hard can it be?
You will first be dismayed by the support tool chains.  For Windows there are a number of compiled programs with grandma-friendly user interfaces with documentation written yesterday.  For Linux there are at least two group of users who are not terribly interested in helping you, designed to fill your computer with viruses and usable for only compiling swathes of low-level code.
This is the next tool chain if you want to be daring.
You're not going to get rich coding this
C is not a very high-level language.  Knowledge of C alone is virtually useless

Do you know how to tell others?
I've been thinking about this part. Can this programmer write their own coding standard?
I rarely write my own coding standard, but it's easy to do it for some cases. Some people needs standard, so I usually write them. If you aren't a polyglot programmer, I think it's a great idea to not tell (or I mean, check if you don't have one) if you don't rewrit code, then it's not necessary to rewrite it.

Response: I use Google search. It's unlikely that I'm going to persuade Mary add the computer family. She needs take lessons and learn how code --- or better yet, get hooked up an answering interpreting service. The only reason has hook down is Mary, humans, have failed meet criteria for using computers. Goodnight everybody!
